# Boss Baller

## Description 

This is an RPG game that focuses on bossfights. The main goal of the game is to train players on reflexes and bossfights skills in general. Its coded in Love2D Lua.

This game targets all the people who have already beaten many games like Hollow Knight, CupHead, Undertale, Deltarune and all the other famous ones. Here I try to make something new, a game where everyone can create their own bossfight, publish it and try to beat other bosses created by all users around the globe. Similarly to Geometry Dash.

The game isn't out yet, but when the first release comes out it will be available for PC on Steam (not 100% sure). Later on it will be released for console and mobile.
